# Responsive Layout

Zephyr UI is designed to support a wide range of screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops. We provide a set of tools and guidelines to help you build fully responsive layouts.

## Breakpoints

We use a standard set of breakpoints to define different screen sizes:

- **xs**: < 600px
- **sm**: 600px - 960px
- **md**: 960px - 1280px
- **lg**: 1280px - 1920px
- **xl**: > 1920px

(Note: These are conceptual. The actual implementation details for responsive tools will be documented here once `T-CORE-02` is completed.)

## Grid System

A responsive grid system is planned for a future release. It will allow you to create flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

## Responsive Utilities

We will also provide a set of responsive utility widgets and extensions to show or hide content based on the current breakpoint.
